### BREAKING CHANGES

* `INgxDatatableConfig.messages` now requires new keys for the pager aria labels.
* **angular:** Angular v19 or higher is required.
* The datatable body no longer has spacing below the last row.
  If needed for whatever reason, this must be added manually.
  Workarounds removing this extra space must be dropped.
* Previously `CellContext.rowIndex` was a `string` if the row was inside a group.
  Now `CellContext.rowIndex` is always a number.
  Either containing the index of the row or if the row is inside a group, the index of the group.
  To access the index value of a row within a group, use the new`CellContext.rowInGroupIndex`.
* The row detail context (`RowDetailContext`) no longer contains `disableRow$?: Observable<boolean>`.
  Use the new `disabled: boolean` value instead.
* The cell context (`CellContext`) no longer contains `disableRow$?: Observable<boolean>`.
  Use the new `disabled: boolean` value instead.
* `disableRowCheck` will only be called with actual rows.
  Although documented otherwise, in the case of groups, the `disableRowCheck`
  was only called for groups instead of each row inside that group.
  This allows disabling single rows inside a group and not only entire groups.
  
  To update the disabled state of a row just update the row itself instead of using the previous `disableRow$` subject.
* Previously, cell values were bound using `innerHTML`.
  With this change they are now bound using normal data binding.
  This means that any html markup will no longer be rendered.
  To restore the previous behavior set `bindAsUnsafeHtml`
  on columns where needed.
  
  We decided to change this behavior,
  as binding `innerHTML` can lead to HTML injection.
  Especially in table content which are often untrusted
  user generated content.
* Header cell names are now bound using data binding
  instead of `innerHTML`.
  Use a `headerTemplate` to provide custom html markup.
* Almost every public API has now proper types.
  While this should in theory not affect applications
  it will now fail compilation
  if the APIs were used in an incorrect manner.
* Requires at least Angular 17.0 and rxjs 7.8.0.
* Previously the datatable
  applied `box-sizing: border-box` to all its elements.
  This is no longer the case.
  
  Custom themes that depend on this must set this behavior manually, using:
  
   ```css
     *,
     *:before,
     *:after {
       box-sizing: border-box;
     }
   ```
* All inputs except `template` of `DatatableFooterDirective` have been dropped.
  
  Those were unused. Remove any usages without replacement.
* The datatable no longer accepts
  `undefined` as a value of the `count` input.
  
  The TypeScript type never allowed `undefined` but it previously worked anyway.
  Now passing `undefined` will lead to an error.
  Instead of `undefined` just pass `0` which has the same effect.
* removed `ResizeableDirective`. This directive was intended for internal use to handle column resizing, which is now managed directly in the `DataTableHeaderCellComponent`.
* Removed several symbols from the public API that were intended to be internal.
* removed polyfill for `elementsFromPoint` since `elementsFromPoint` is now supported by all major browsers.
* changed `Keys` enum to use `key` value instead of `keyCode`. `keyCode` is deprecated from `KeyBoardEvent` and should be replaced with `key`.
* Vendor prefixes are no longer
  applied for css `transform`. The related helpers
  are removed from the public api.
* Angular v18.2 or above is required.
* Change signature from onBodyPage({ offset }: any): void to onBodyPage(offset: number): void

### DEPRECATIONS

* `PageEvent.limit` should no longer be used.
  Use the `PageEvent.pageSize` instead as this will hold the same value
  as `PageEvent.limit` if the table used the value of the limit input.
